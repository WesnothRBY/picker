#### Yet Another Random Addon

There was random addon called WCG for 1.8 (and earlier wesnoth versions) maintained by grrr. As one day grrr went on a wesbreak I took it and continue maintaing all of that stuff for a while (that was the time when the name changed to RMP). Now as I decided not to support RMP anymore new addon called RBY has to emerge.

#### Map sets

* Adv + Con - Adventurous + Conservative
* Adventurous - new maps made by Doc as well as best UMC maps
* Classic - conservative maps from previous mainline release
* Conservative - maps distributed with wesnoth

#### Eras

* No mirror era ported to work with MP campaigns
